# angular2portfolio
This is a simple single-page web application that displays some general information about me and some of the projects that I have worked on recently.
It includes a variety of different Components, 
* home-panel
* about-panel
* portfolio-panel
* contact-panel
* info-blurb
* project-details
* social-button

It makes use of an API to pull all of the data from a MySQL database.

This was my first exposure to Angular 2, so it was mostly meant to serve as an introduction for me.
