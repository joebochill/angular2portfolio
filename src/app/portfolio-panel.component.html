                        <h2><p><a href="http://www.eaton.com/pxi" target="_blank">Power Xpert Insight</a> was the first project I worked on after joining Eaton Corporation in the Fall of 2012. This was the first attempt at bringing User-Centered Design to Eaton's product line. PXI is an online power and energy monitoring solution. It connects to electrical devices and displays assorted information from those devices, including real time values, historical trends, and alarms for traits such as current, voltage, power, etc.</p>

                        <p>The redesign process for PXI took approximately two years from initial research to first release. We have since released two more major versions of the software and we are currently working on a hosted version. Power Xpert Insight won the Plant Engineering <a href="http://www.plantengineering.com/events-and-awards/product-of-the-year/2014/2014-product-of-the-year-winners.html" target="_blank">Product of the Year</a> Gold Award for Energy Management in 2013 and 2014.</p></h2>
